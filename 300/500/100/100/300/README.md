Choose "Layer" > "New" > "Camera".

Now the only thing that you'll need to worry about with the camera settings is the millimeters. So the larger the millimeter amount the closer it will be to like whatever it is you're viewing.

So for example if I have a 15 millimeter one you can see it like zoomed out of it first. If I change this to a let's say 35 millimeter you can see it zoomed into it. 

So I usually like to use 28. 35 is good too, but I usually use 28. 

It's easier to move the camera and stuff with a **null layer** so I'm just going to create that and link my camera to the null and make sure to click the 3d.

For us, stay with the default configuration, it is a Preset of **35 mm**, and name it **Main Camera**. Click **OK**.
