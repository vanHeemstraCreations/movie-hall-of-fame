What you want to do first is creating a new solid layer (ctrl+alt+shift+y) and name it "Element 3D", the color you pick doesn't matter.

Then search for element in ‘effects & presets’ and add it to your solid layer.

Now click on scene set up (it could take a while to load up depending on your computer), click on create, when you do that, you’re going to see a lot of pretty shapes and we’re going to select the square box.

For the box we are going to transform and increase the scale by a lot, I'm doing 500%.

Now we’re going back to the box and set size XYZ to 1,00;0,00;1,00.

Now we have the floor, for the walls right-click on the BoxModel and select duplicate model, change the size XYZ to 1,00;1,00;0,00.

You can change to wall length to your likings by increasing or decreasing the second value for size XYZ.

Go to transform and adjust the position settings until the left side of the wall aligns with the edge of the floor.

Now to create the right wall, we’re going to duplicate the BoxModel used for the left wall, and adjust the position of the duplicated wall to align with the opposite end of the floor.

For the back wall, duplicate either the right or left wall BoxModel.

Rotate the duplicated wall by 90 degrees.

Adjust the position settings so that it aligns with the end of the floor and both side walls.

For our final wall, duplicate the BoxModel used for the back wall and adjust the x position value from positive to negative, to place it on the opposite side.

And now our room is almost done. 

Don't get confused by the walls below the floor level – these won't be visible at the end.

Now to make the ceiling, we're going to duplicate the BoxModel used for the floor and increase the y position until it appears to rest on top of the walls, or just slightly below that.

We've completed building our 3D room!

Also something important by clicking this box, you can show or hide a wall.

I'll use this frequently later on since it makes it easier to see inside the room when we're putting our models in place.

**NOTE**: Leave the "front" wall hidden for now, so we can see the inside of the room.

### Camera
