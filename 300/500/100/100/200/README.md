For the Office Tempered Glass Door to be transparent in Element 3D, for the Glass set the Blend Mode to **Add** under Advanced inside the Scene Setup of Element 3D effect control.

For the Office Tempered Glass Door to have chrome like armature in Element 3D, for the armature choose **Metal_Diffused** from the Scene Material.

For the Office Tempered Glass Door to be part of the Front Wall (see **Walls and Roof**), one has to extrude part of the Front Wall.

Plugins used:

- "HandyCam" at https://aescripts.com/handycam/?aff=47

It's easier to move a camera and stuff with a **null layer** so I'm just going to create that. 

Choose "Layer" > "New" > "Null".

Give it the plugin effect of **HandyCam** and it will link a camera (called ```HandyCam_Camera```) to the null (called ```HandyCam_Controller```) once you have click the Setup. Make sure to click the 3d.

Now the only thing that you'll need to worry about with the camera settings is the millimeters. So the larger the millimeter amount the closer it will be to like whatever it is you're viewing.

So for example if I have a 15 millimeter one you can see it like zoomed out of it first. If I change this to a let's say 35 millimeter you can see it zoomed into it. 

So I usually like to use 28. 35 is good too, but I usually use 28.

For us, stay with the default configuration, it is a Preset of **35 mm**, and leave its name to **HandyCam_Camera**. Click **OK**.
