What you want to do first is creating a new solid layer (ctrl+alt+shift+y) and name it "Element 3D", the color you pick doesn't matter, but we pick black.

Then search for element in ‘effects & presets’ and add it to your solid layer.

Now click on scene set up (it could take a while to load up depending on your computer), click on create, when you do that, you’re going to see a lot of pretty shapes and we’re going to select the square box.

For the box we are going to transform and increase the scale by a lot, I'm doing 500%.

Now we’re going back to the box and set size XYZ to 1,00;0,00;1,00.

Now we have the floor, for the walls right-click on the BoxModel and select duplicate model, change the size XYZ to 1,00;1,00;0,00.

You can change to wall length to your likings by increasing or decreasing the second value for size XYZ.

Go to transform and adjust the position settings until the left side of the wall aligns with the edge of the floor.

Now to create the right wall, we’re going to duplicate the BoxModel used for the left wall, and adjust the position of the duplicated wall to align with the opposite end of the floor.

For the back wall, duplicate either the right or left wall BoxModel.

Rotate the duplicated wall by 90 degrees.

Adjust the position settings so that it aligns with the end of the floor and both side walls.

For our final wall, duplicate the BoxModel used for the back wall and adjust the x position value from positive to negative, to place it on the opposite side.

And now our room is almost done. 

Don't get confused by the walls below the floor level – these won't be visible at the end.

Now to make the ceiling, we're going to duplicate the BoxModel used for the floor and increase the y position until it appears to rest on top of the walls, or just slightly below that.

**WARNING**: Now all walls, ceiling, and floor will respond the same when applying a texture or color to them. To make them independent, click on each of their ```scene material```, right-click and choose "Duplicate and Replace". Now they will all behave independently.

We've completed building our 3D room!

Also something important by clicking this box, you can show or hide a wall.

I'll use this frequently later on since it makes it easier to see inside the room when we're putting our models in place.

**TIP**: To make the floor reflect items that are placed on it, as well as the walls surrounding the floor, choose the ```Floor``` in the Scene Setup of the Element 3D layer. Under the Edit tab, scroll down all the way until the **Reflect Mode** and choose ```Mirror Surface``` from the drop-down list. See Tips & Tricks.

**NOTE**: Leave the "Front Wall" hidden for now, so we can see the inside of the room.

Plugins used:

Choose "Layer" > "New" > "Camera".

Now the only thing that you'll need to worry about with the camera settings is the millimeters. So the larger the millimeter amount the closer it will be to like whatever it is you're viewing.

So for example if I have a 15 millimeter one you can see it like zoomed out of it first. If I change this to a let's say 35 millimeter you can see it zoomed into it. 

So I usually like to use 28. 35 is good too, but I usually use 28. 

It's easier to move the camera and stuff with a **null layer** so I'm just going to create that and link my camera to the null and make sure to click the 3d.

For us, stay with the default configuration, it is a Preset of **35 mm**, and name it **Main Camera**. Click **OK**.
